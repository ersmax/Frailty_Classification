# Frailty Classification
Frailty poses a significant challenge for aging populations, as growing elderly care needs strain healthcare systems. In response, this study introduces a machine‑learning framework for classifying and predicting frailty, using publicly available EU datasets and comparing its performance with recent work from North America and Asia. We focus on three main objectives: (1) classifying frailty among older adults, (2) detecting frailty in post‑stroke patients, and (3) forecasting health improvements.

For the first objective, we merge physical measurements with socio‑clinical variables; for the second, we derive four gait metrics from wearable inertial sensors. We then assess several classifiers, emphasizing models that clinicians can interpret, and employ PCA to illustrate how well the groups separate. Our results highlight that feature importance varies by country, underscoring the need to account for cultural and demographic differences in model development.

Despite challenges such as imbalanced classes and scarce longitudinal follow‑up, our framework shows robust generalizability and interpretability. It surpasses current methods in elderly frailty classification and nearly matches leading stroke‑related approaches. By combining sensor‑based metrics with socio‑clinical data, the framework equips clinicians with a practical tool for frailty evaluation. Finally, we emphasize the necessity of interoperable health systems and call for closer collaboration between healthcare professionals and machine‑learning experts to shift from reactive treatment toward proactive frailty prevention across diverse populations.
